K227.

NIST K227 is an engineered glass with
0.1639  O by mass
0.0935 Si by mass and
0.7427 Pb by mass.

The presence of O in a Pb matrix is interesting because the O Kâˆ’L3 is
strongly absorbed by Pb and because the mean atomic number of the glass
is much larger than that of many common materials used as an O
standard (Al2O3, MgO, SiO2, etc.). We considered a range of E0
from 5 to 30 keV and standard materials MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, and a
compositionally similar engineered glass, K229.

K229 is:
0.2099  O by mass,
0.1402 Si by mass, and
0.6498 Pb by mass.
